        <h1>Strategies and tactics to win at Connect 4 online</h1>

        <h3>At the start of the game</h3>
        <p>
            In order to start well a Connect 4 game on board, paper or online, it is important to place a maximum of checkers in
            the middle column so that you maximize possibilities of aligning 4 checkers in the following turns. This tactic prevents your 
            opponent of doing the same while using column. The next step is to elaborate a strategy consisting of traps which shall pressure 
            your opponent into playing a move leading to your victory by aligning on row or reduced column and thus obtaining a higher ranking!
        </p>

        <h3>The double line at Connect 4</h3>
        <p>
            One simple way of trapping your opponent at Connect 4 game on board, paper or online is to create a winning double line
            (two lines which lack one checker in order to have a line of 4) in order to compel them to make a move which would lead to you being 
            able to align a line of 4 at the next turn.
        </p>

        <h3>How to beat a novice at Connect 4</h3>
        <p>
            Whenever you start a Connect 4 game and your opponent is not attentive, you may try to align three checkers on the lowest line. 
            Your opponent shall then only have the choice between reacting on the left or on the right, in whichever case you win the game!
        </p>

        <h3>Blocking columns</h3>
        <p>
            The following strategy should be mastered if you wish to obtain a higher ranking at Connect 4 game while trying to win horizontally 
            or vertically: try to block columns in such a way that whenever your opponent places a checker or pieces of discs on a row or a column, 
            you would win at the next turn (or it would lead to a double line). The goal is to lead your opponent into making moves he does not want to 
            make and which enable you the freedom of developing traps for the next steps.
        </p>

        <h3>Connect 4 on play</h3>

            find suitable to put the pieces of discs. The 4 pieces will have to aligned diagonally, horizontally or vertically so that you could win.

            them turn. You then control the row from middle since the begining to win horizontally at your final turn on the red block appearance.
